# Mondrian-art-Compostion3-Grid
After I finish the basic Grid lesson, There is a class challenge. I had to make a Mondrian art which is Composition No. III, with red, blue, yellow, and black, 1929. I made the HTML code and Grid columns and rows. I set the size and Bg of each div that are Grid items then I used grid-area to set each of them to place correctly.
